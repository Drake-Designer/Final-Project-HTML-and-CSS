      <h2>Origins and Evolution</h2>
      <p>Progressive rock, often abbreviated as prog rock, is a broad genre of rock music that developed in the
        United Kingdom and United States throughout the mid to late 1960s. Initially termed "progressive pop",
        the style grew out of a backdrop of cultural and artistic aspirations that sought to elevate rock music
        to new levels of artistic credibility. Bands such as Pink Floyd, King Crimson, and Yes were among the
        pioneers, pushing the boundaries of rock with influences from classical, jazz, and avant-garde music.

      <h2>The Golden Era</h2>
      <p>The 1970s are widely regarded as the golden era of progressive rock. During this period, the genre saw
        its greatest popularity and artistic innovation. Albums like "The Dark Side of the Moon" by Pink Floyd
        and "Close to the Edge" by Yes epitomized the genre's ambition with complex compositions, elaborate live
        shows, and conceptual album themes that engaged with larger philosophical and existential questions.</p>

      <h2>Musical Characteristics</h2>
      <p>Progressive rock is distinguished by its extended song formats, intricate instrumentals, and complex
        lyrical themes. Unlike the verse-chorus structure typical of many rock genres, progressive rock often
        involves compositions that change time signatures and tempos throughout a piece. Instruments not
        typically found in rock, such as the mellotron and the synthesizer, became staples in the progressive
        rock setup.</p>

      <h2>Decline and Revival</h2>
      <p>By the late 1970s, the rise of punk rock and new wave music led to a decline in the popularity of
        progressive rock, with many bands either disbanding or shifting their musical focus. However, the genre
        experienced a revival in the late 1980s and early 1990s with the emergence of neo-progressive rock bands
        like Marillion and Pendragon, who drew heavily from the sounds and styles of the genre's forebears.</p>

      <h2>Legacy and Influence</h2>
      <p>Today, progressive rock continues to influence a wide range of musical genres and artists. The genre's
        emphasis on technical proficiency and complex composition has found a new audience in modern progressive
        metal bands, while its experimental spirit lives on in various forms of experimental and alternative
        rock.</p>
